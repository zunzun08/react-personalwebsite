## Main Content

The core of your article goes here. Use:

### Subheadings for organization

Regular paragraphs for explanation.

- Like this one

1. Numbered lists
2. For sequential steps

**Bold text** for emphasis and *italic* for technical terms.

def example_function():
    """Example Python code"""
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Math (when MDX with KaTeX is configured)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\alpha = \min\left(1, \frac{p(x')q(x|x')}{p(x)q(x'|x)}\right)
$$
